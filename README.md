This repository provides supplementary material to my master thesis
submitted in fulfilment of the requirement for the Master of Science ETH
in Applied Mathematics. The work described was conducted between
September 2020 and February 2021, under the supervision of Professor P.
L. Buehlmann, in the Department of Mathematics at ETH Zurich.

My thesis proposes Generalized Linear Anchor REgression (GLARE), which
constitutes a generalisation of Anchor Regression (AR) by
[Rothenhaeusler, Meinshausen, Buehlmann and
Peters](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rssb.12398)
to Generalised Linear Models (GLM).

In this repository you can find the scripts that are used to reproduced
the data used in the thesis. To generate the material you have to
install the glare R package <https://github.com/rakittam/glare>.
